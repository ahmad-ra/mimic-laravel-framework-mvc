# mimic-laravel-framework-mvc

this is a humble trial to make a clone of laravel MVC framework , for education purposes and to strengthen my skills

till now I managed to finish the (model) part , and parts of the controller part .

But ofcoarse Laravel framework is huge and very well made which is too much for one person to clone alone , so this is an educational 

project where anyone in the community can help in it in order to brush his programming skills , so pull requests are essential! .

this is a collaborative educational project that will be built by the community
